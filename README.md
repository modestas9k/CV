> Currently **open** to any opportunities where I can write code and learn stuff.

I've spent half of my life for *music* - 13 years with flute, 2 year with bass guitar and piano was always nearby. Lasted a long time to realize that I donâ€™t like being in the spotlight, to fight real time stress and low salary.

After I left music academy I found new passion - *Jewelcrafting*. That peace and quiet - love that. I could spend days for simple ring to start shine. After more than half year I found myself at a dead end with a high debt for course and more expenses if I go further. If interested what I create, here is my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/modest.skirius/).

Then came my brother to rescue and offered to try what he did when he was struggling in hes life - *Web Development*. And I did, with a lot of passion recently graduated *Frond-end* course at **Code Academy** in Vilnius. I had two mentors and I learned a lot, but main thing for me in this stage was to learn how to learn, write clean code, understand what computer are saying when throwing an error and be useful in team projects.

## Skills

 - **Languages/Technologies** - HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js, React.js, Bulma, Material-ui, styled-components, StoryBook, Node.js, MySQL, Postman, Firebase, Git.
 - **Researching** - Mentors said that gazing at the screen doesn't do much, learn how to use documentations + Google and StackOverflow is key to get through the "I don't know" phase.
