# Modestas Skirius

> Currently **open** to any junior front-end developer opportunities.

With passion recently graduated *Frond-end* course at **Code Academy** in Vilnius. I learned many things, such as front-end development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, various popular libraries and frameworks (Vue.js, React, Bulma, Material-ui), writing clean code, debugging, working in a team, using Git/GitHub to manage and contribute code to a team project, and most importantly - I learned how to learn new things.

## Skills

 - **Languages/Technologies** - HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js, React.js, Bulma, Material-ui, styled-components, StoryBook, Node.js, MySQL, Postman, Firebase, Git.
 - **Researching** - Mentors said that gazing at the screen doesn't do much, learn how to use documentations + Google and StackOverflow is key to get through the "I don't know" phase.
